# Learn_MarkDown
In this repository I shall articulate all the concept to make your documents fancy and well formated.
# Why MarkDown
Markdown is gaining popularity among writers, developers, and content creators due to its versatility. It is a free markup language you can use to format plain text and generate different outputs. It implies that you do not have to invest in expensive software anymore to create and publish diverse content.
Many free editors can be downloaded or used online, making Markdown suitable for individuals and teams. Here, we'll explain what Markdown is and why it's worth using
# What is MarkDown
You can apply it to create different types of content such as notes, presentations, documentation, websites, and resumes.
Markdown has different variants or flavors and implementations (also known as parsers). Each flavor offers a slightly different set of features. They can include combinations of basic and extended syntax.
The basic syntax includes paragraphs, headings, font, or lists. The extended syntax includes tables, alignments, block codes, or footnotes. You can use any Markdown flavor such as GitHub Flavoured Markdown or Trello's Markdown to develop content.
###### We use .md extension for the Markdown files
# 1- Heading
# For large heading we use single '#'
## Second largest heading we use double '##'
###### for smallest heading we use six '######'

# 2- Line Break or block of text
For line break we use '>'
> this is the line break example

# 3- Face of text
We use double ' ** ' for making the bold text

**This is bold text**

We use ' * ' for italic text

like *This is italic text*

# 4- Bullets Points
We use ' - ' for making the dotted list and nested dotted ' tab - ' list
like:
- 1
- 2
- 3
  - 1a
  - 2a
  - 3a
  
In case of numbering list we use ' 1. ' like 

1. day1
2. day2
3. day3
# Links
For Hyper links we use ' <> '

For making a code we use ' ``` ' adn for making a snippet of code we use '```' like this 

this is `code` 
``` 
this is also 
code
